**Version:** 1.0.0 **Date:** 2026-01-04 **Standard:** IEEE 830 (simplified for MVP)

--------------

Introduction
---------------

Purpose
~~~~~~~

This SRS defines MVP requirements for AirGap Transfer, a command-line utility for safely transferring large files across air-gap boundaries.

Scope
~~~~~

**Product:** AirGap Transfer — a minimal CLI tool for chunked file transfers via removable media.

**In Scope:**

- Split large datasets into chunks for USB transfer
- Reconstruct files from chunks with integrity verification
- Resume interrupted transfers
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Out of Scope (per** :doc:`Principles <../../meta/principles>`\ **):**

- Network transfers, cloud sync, auto-updates
- Compression or encryption (defer to post-MVP)
- GUI interface
- Real-time synchronization
- Ollama-specific logic (general-purpose only)
