Test Plan
=========

AirGap Transfer
---------------

**Version:** 1.0.0 **Date:** 2026-01-04 **Standard:** IEEE 829 (simplified for MVP)

--------------

Introduction
---------------

This test plan covers MVP requirements (FR-001 through FR-045, NFR-001 through NFR-006).

--------------

Test Strategy
----------------

Test Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~

=========== ====================== ======================
Level       Scope                  Tools
=========== ====================== ======================
Unit        Individual functions   Rust ``#[test]``
Integration Component interactions Rust integration tests
System      End-to-end workflows   Manual testing
=========== ====================== ======================

Features Not Tested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===================== ===================
Feature               Reason
===================== ===================
USB hardware failures External dependency
Filesystem internals  Platform dependency
Tar format compliance Third-party library
===================== ===================

Test Automation Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MVP:** Manual testing primarily. Unit tests for core logic.

**Unit tests (automatable):**

=========== ========================================
Component   What to Test
=========== ========================================
chunker.rs  Chunk size calculations, streaming logic
verifier.rs Checksum generation and verification
manifest.rs JSON serialization, state management
=========== ========================================

**Integration tests (partially automatable):**

====================== ====================
Test                   Automation Notes
====================== ====================
Pack + Unpack workflow Use temp directories
Manifest persistence   In-memory filesystem
Checksum verification  Known test vectors
====================== ====================

**System tests (manual only):**

========================= ===================================
Test                      Why Manual
========================= ===================================
USB detection             Requires physical USB hardware
Cross-platform behavior   Requires multiple test machines
Large file handling       Time-intensive, requires disk space
Resume after interruption Requires manual interruption
========================= ===================================
