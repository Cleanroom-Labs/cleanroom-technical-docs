About
-----

This blog features updates, tutorials, and insights about the AirGap project suite—tools for secure, offline computing in air-gapped environments.

Topics include:

- Privacy-first software architecture
- Air-gapped deployment workflows
- Offline productivity tools
- Cross-platform Rust development
- Real-world use cases from government, healthcare, finance, and research

All AirGap projects are open source (MIT/Apache-2.0) and designed with a core principle: **privacy through data locality**.

Foundation Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AirGap suite currently consists of three foundation projects—AirGap Whisper, AirGap Deploy, and AirGap Transfer—that we're actively developing in the near term. These tools demonstrate core patterns for privacy-first, offline computing and may serve as building blocks for future air-gapped projects.

We're open to collaboration and welcome ideas from the community about how to expand the ecosystem of air-gapped computing tools.
