Technical Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the Cleanroom Labs technical documentation. This documentation covers three **foundation Rust projects** designed for secure, air-gapped environments, with room for future expansion:

- **AirGap Transfer**: Large file transfer utility
- **AirGap Deploy**: Developer deployment packaging tool
- **Cleanroom Whisper**: End-user transcription application

These three projects represent our near-term development focus and demonstrate core patterns for privacy-first, offline computing. All projects follow strict privacy-first design principles with zero network communication and minimal dependencies, establishing a foundation that can support future air-gapped tools.
