AirGap Project Suite Documentation
===================================

Welcome to the AirGap Project Suite documentation. This suite consists of three independent Rust projects designed for secure, air-gapped environments:

- **AirGap Whisper**: End-user transcription application
- **airgap-deploy**: Developer deployment packaging tool
- **airgap-transfer**: Large file transfer utility

All projects follow strict privacy-first design principles with zero network communication and minimal dependencies.
