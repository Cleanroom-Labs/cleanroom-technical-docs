Technical Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the Cleanroom Labs technical documentation — the central reference for the design, specifications, and development practices behind our privacy-first tools for air-gapped environments.

How this documentation is organized
------------------------------------

**Projects** contains the specifications, design documents, and roadmaps for each individual project. **General Information** covers licensing, scope, and competitive positioning across the suite. **Design** describes the core principles and architectural patterns shared across projects. **Systems Engineering** defines the requirements engineering framework, standards alignment, and guidance for writing specifications. **Project Management** tracks release strategy, roadmaps, and progress. **Developer Resources** provides practical guides for contributing, including sphinx-needs usage, Rust API integration, and coding standards.
