Licensing
=========

Open Source License
-------------------

All Cleanroom Labs projects are released under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**. The AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license that ensures software freedom. Under this license, you are free to:

- **Use** the software for any purpose
- **Study** and modify the source code
- **Distribute** copies of the original or modified software

These freedoms come with obligations:

- Derivative works must be licensed under the AGPL-3.0
- Source code must be made available to recipients of the software
- If you run a modified version as a network service, you must offer the source to its users

The full license text is included in the ``LICENSE`` file in each project repository.

Commercial Licensing
--------------------

Organizations that wish to use Cleanroom Labs software without the obligations of the AGPL-3.0 may obtain a commercial license. A commercial license provides:

- **Exemption from copyleft** — integrate the software into proprietary products without releasing your source code
- **Deployment flexibility** — distribute modified versions without AGPL-3.0 obligations
- **Support options** — access to priority support and consulting (terms vary by agreement)

Commercial licensing is available for all three projects individually or as a suite.
